##### Parameters

-   `requestData` (Data struct): The request data received from the DApp, including the callback address, data type, and question.

##### Modifies

-   `requestIndexToAddress`: Updates the mapping of request index to callback address.
-   `responses`: Adds the response object to the list of responses.
-   `requestIndexLength`: Increments the request index length.

#### Function: checkDataType

##### Description

The `checkDataType` function is a pure function that validates the data type specified in the given request data. It compares the data type with predefined types ("Numeric" and "String") and returns a response indicating whether the data type is valid or invalid.

##### Parameters

-   `_data` (Data struct): The request data containing the data type to be checked.

##### Returns

-   `response` (Response struct): The response object indicating the validity of the data type. It includes the status ("valid" or "invalid"), a message describing the status.

#### Function: getCallbackAddressByIndex

##### Description

The `getCallbackAddressByIndex` function is a view function that retrieves the callback address associated with a given index in the `requestIndexToAddress` mapping. It allows you to retrieve the callback address based on the provided index.

##### Parameters

-   `_index` (uint256): The index of the mapping from which to retrieve the callback address.

##### Returns

-   `address`: The callback address stored at the specified index in the `requestIndexToAddress` mapping.

#### Function: sendAnswerToDApp

##### Description

The `sendAnswerToDApp` function is defined as part of a smart contract and is designed to send an answer to a decentralized application (DApp). It takes two parameters: index, an unsigned integer, and answer, a string containing the response. The function can receive Ether (payable) to be sent with the call.

##### Parameters

-   `index` (uint256): The index of the callback address.
-   `answer` (string): The answer you want to send to DApp.
